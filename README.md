Distribution
------------

For Windows users there is binary a version in [sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtboxeditor/?source=dlp) section. From version 1.09 distribution is split to 2 part:
* qt-box-editor executable (e.g. qt-box-editor-1.11.exe) - share build
* qt-box-editor dependecies (e.g. qt-box-editor-1.11-dependecies.zip) - needed 3rd party libraries to run qt-box editor.
There is a hope that qt-box-editor dependecies can be used for next few qt-box-editor releases.

On other platforms you need to build qt-box-editor from source. You will need QT4 (v1.11 is compatible with QT5), leptonica and tesseract.
