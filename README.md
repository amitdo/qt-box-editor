DESCRIPTION
-----------

QT Box Editor is tool for adjusting [tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) v3 (a.k.a Legacy engine) box files. Aim of this project is to provide easy and efficient way for editing regardless file size.
**It is useless for training tesseract v4 and above (LSTM engine).**

Release information can be found in CHANGELOG file. Code and artwork contribution is welcomed.

QT box editor is a successor of [tesseract-gui project](https://github.com/mk219533/tesseract-gui) that is not developed anymore. Name of application was changed due to name collision with project http://tesseract-gui.sourceforge.net.

Requirements: QT5, tesseract & leptonica and (optionally) cmake.

For building you can use `qmake-qt5` or `cmake`

For cmake build you will need to compile&install tesseract by cmake otherwise cmake relevant files (e.g. ` tesseractConfig.cmake`) will not be created and installed.

## cmake windows build

`<your_QT5_path>` could be e.g. `f:/Qt/5.15.2/msvc2019_64`
`<your_tesseract_installation>` could be e.g. `f:/win64`

```sh
set QTDIR=<your_QT5_path>
set PATH=%QTDIR%/bin;%PATH%
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<your_QT5_path>;<your_tesseract_installation>"
cmake --build build --config Release --verbose
```

The Output will be at build\Release\qt-box-editor-1.13.0.exe

## cmake linux build

```sh
cmake -B build
make
```

## qmake linux build

```sh
